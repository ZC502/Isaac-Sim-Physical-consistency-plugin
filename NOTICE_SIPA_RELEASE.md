📢 **NOTICE: SIPA (Spatial Intelligence Physical Audit) v1.0 Released**

A standalone diagnostic protocol for quantifying physical consistency in Spatial AI is now available as a primary repository.

SIPA operates as an engine-agnostic "Physical Judge". It is a non-intrusive framework that requires zero access to simulator internals or model weights, making it a dedicated tool for **Technical Due Diligence (Tech DD)** and objective benchmarking.

**SIPA is designed to audit:**
- **Physics Simulators**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim, MuJoCo, PyBullet, Gazebo.
- **Neural World Models**: World Labs (Marble), OpenAI Sora, Runway Gen-3 (via pose extraction).
- **Robotic Foundation Models**: End-effector & Locomotion trajectory auditing.
- **Real-world Capture**: Motion sequences from OptiTrack, Vicon, or SLAM.

**Metric Focus**: The Physical Integrity Rating (PIR) provides a quantitative baseline for evaluating causal fluency vs. visual hallucination.
